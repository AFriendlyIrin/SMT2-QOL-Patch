before you have to let[WAIT]
them all spin again. So[LINE]
if you get two out of[LINE]
three symbols,[WAIT]
it's a good idea to hold[LINE]
them.[WAIT]
[LINE]
Just test it out for[LINE]
yourself to see how it[LINE]
works.[WAIT]
If you get three of the[LINE]
same symbols lined up in[LINE]
the center,[WAIT]
you can choose to play[LINE]
the Bonus game with your[LINE]
winnings.[WAIT]
[LINE]
The Bonus game is a[LINE]
three-row game that[LINE]
costs 5 coins per play.[WAIT]
There are 27 possible[LINE]
ways to win--in other[WAIT]
words, if a matching[LINE]
symbol is anywhere in an[LINE]
adjacent column,[WAIT]
it counts. But you can't[LINE]
Hold anything in this[LINE]
game.[WAIT]
[LINE]
When you play the Bonus[LINE]
game, the six symbols[LINE]
you haven't won anything[WAIT]
with yet become[LINE]
"Challenge Symbols."[WAIT]
[LINE]
Below the reels you'll[LINE]
see a list of symbols--[WAIT]
the Challenge Symbols[LINE]
will be lit up.[WAIT]
As soon as you get a[LINE]
match with a Challenge[LINE]
symbol,[WAIT]
its light will go out.[WAIT]
[LINE]
The bonus game ends when[LINE]
all the Challenge[LINE]
Symbols go out,[WAIT]
when you run out of[LINE]
"WIN" Coins,[WAIT]
or if you win 1000[LINE]
Coins, whichever comes[LINE]
first.[WAIT]
[LINE]
One last thing--even if[LINE]
you're not playing the[LINE]
Bonus game,[WAIT]
the JP symbol can match[LINE]
up on any of the lines.[WAIT]
How much you win with[LINE]
the JP symbol is random,[LINE]
you never can tell![WAIT]
[LINE]
If you do not want to[LINE]
play the Bonus game,[WAIT]
or want to stop playing[LINE]
the Bonus game,[WAIT]
just press down and you[LINE]
can "TAKE SCORE" to keep[LINE]
your winnings![WAIT]
If you want to quit[LINE]
playing, press the L[LINE]
button,[WAIT]
and the R button starts[LINE]
the game. Give it a[LINE]
shot!![WAIT]

In addition to symbols,[LINE]
the numbers 1-3 can[LINE]

[LINE]
4 and 5 is "HOLD."[WAIT]

you get double what you[LINE]

7 or 8 is "LUCKY[LINE]

When you get this, any[LINE]
symbols in the center[LINE]

Lucky Symbols.[WAIT]
[LINE]
Any symbol that is lit[LINE]
up as a Lucky Symbol[LINE]
gets the increased[WAIT]
payoffs that you boosted[LINE]
with "RAISE" when you[LINE]
win.[WAIT]
[LINE]
If you win over 100[LINE]
Coins in a pop,[WAIT]
then all the Symbol[LINE]

It's a 9-reel, 8-line[LINE]

It involves an "Any"[LINE]
game and a "Star" game.[WAIT]
[LINE]
If you line up three of[LINE]
the same symbols on one[LINE]
of the eight lines,[WAIT]
you win.[WAIT]
The number of lines that[LINE]

[LINE]
Increase your bet with[LINE]
the A button,[WAIT]
and decrease it with the[LINE]
B button. R button[LINE]
starts the game.[WAIT]
[LINE]
If you hit Select, you[LINE]
you will automatically[LINE]

[LINE]
The "Any" game is a[LINE]
bonus,[WAIT]
whereby you win Coins if[LINE]
4 or more Bars or 7s[LINE]
appear in any of the 9[WAIT]
reels in a single spin.[LINE]
5 or more of any other[LINE]
symbol counts as an[WAIT]
"Any" win as well.[WAIT]
[LINE]
The Star Game involves[LINE]
the Star symbols that'll[LINE]
appear in the 9 reels.[WAIT]
If four or more stars[LINE]
appear in a single spin,[WAIT]
that starts the Star[LINE]
game, which adds various[LINE]

Star spins are free![WAIT]
Any time you spin the[LINE]

The 4 stars will be[LINE]

5 Stars activates the[LINE]
"7 Hold."[WAIT]
The 7s will be held, and[LINE]
all other reels will[LINE]

[LINE]
6 Stars activates the[LINE]
"Center Joker."[WAIT]
The center reel will[LINE]
turn into a Joker.[WAIT]
[LINE]
The Joker is a Wildcard[LINE]
symbol.[WAIT]
It can count as any[LINE]
symbol to complete[LINE]
lines.[WAIT]
[LINE]
7 Stars activates the[LINE]
"Cross Joker."[WAIT]
The top, bottom, left,[LINE]
and right reels will all[LINE]
change into Jokers.[WAIT]
[LINE]
8 stars activates the[LINE]
"Corner Joker."[WAIT]
All four of the corner[LINE]
reels will change to[LINE]
Jokers.[WAIT]

So long as any symbol[LINE]

//[LINE]
{DMN}: ...when I offer[LINE]
a direct audience to one[LINE]
in my palace,[WAIT]
none can refuse.[WAIT]
[LINE]
Well then, {Aleph}, let's[LINE]
cut the pleasantries and[LINE]
get right to business.[WAIT]
I'm sure you are here in[LINE]
an attempt to figure out[LINE]
what's going on in[WAIT]
Millennium, so I'll tell[LINE]
you everything.[WAIT]
As you may have[LINE]
suspected already,[WAIT]
those insignificant[LINE]
little Seraphim built[LINE]
Millennium,[WAIT]
thinking they were doing[LINE]
God's will in doing so.[WAIT]
However, building[LINE]
Millennium was actually[LINE]
in direct contention[WAIT]
with what God wants.[WAIT]
While the Seraphim's[LINE]
domineering enslavement[LINE]
of the citizens of[LINE]
Millennium disgusted me[WAIT]
to the core, I knew that[LINE]
eventually that God[LINE]
would exact retribution[WAIT]
upon them, so I just[LINE]
watched while tending to[LINE]
the Abyss.[WAIT]
[LINE]
But who was the one who[LINE]
defeated the angels?[LINE]
Yes, {Aleph}, it was you.[WAIT]
Just who, or what, are[LINE]
you, {Aleph}?[WAIT]
Not only did you defeat[LINE]
such powerful fallen[LINE]
Seraphim,[WAIT]
but the false God that[LINE]
they had created![WAIT]
No, the YHVH you killed[LINE]
in the Center was not[LINE]
the true God...[WAIT]
He was created through[LINE]
the energies produced by[LINE]
the wishful thinking of[WAIT]
the Seraphim....who,[LINE]
thinking he was the true[LINE]
God,[WAIT]
had been serving him all[LINE]
along.[WAIT]
[LINE]
Still, while not the[LINE]
true YHVH,[WAIT]
he was still extremely[LINE]
powerful in his own[LINE]
right.[WAIT]
How is it that you were[LINE]
able to defeat him?[WAIT]
Could it be that you are[LINE]
Satan, God's instrument[LINE]
of judgement,[WAIT]
punishment, and[LINE]
retribution?[WAIT]
That was worrying me,[LINE]
which is why I summoned[LINE]
you here.[WAIT]
....I can tell by the[LINE]
look on your face that[LINE]
this all comes as a[WAIT]
surprise to you...[LINE]
That is good.[WAIT]
It would appear that[LINE]
you are not Satan.[WAIT]

//[LINE]
Unfortunately, that[LINE]
doesn't mean that[LINE]
everything is all right.[WAIT]
I have seen several[LINE]
signs that suggest that[LINE]
Satan is going to[WAIT]
reappear soon.[WAIT]
For example, the fact[LINE]
that Set is starting to[LINE]
awaken.[WAIT]
[LINE]
Set is one of Satan's[LINE]
two halves.[WAIT]
Once Set awakens, it is[LINE]
only a matter of time[LINE]
before he finds his[WAIT]
other half and Satan[LINE]
reappears.[WAIT]
God imprisoned Set here[LINE]
and put him in a deep[LINE]
sleep...[WAIT]
...in order to seal him[LINE]
off and wait until the[LINE]
day that Satan was[WAIT]
needed again. [WAIT]
[LINE]
You see, Satan is a tool[LINE]
of God's wrath,[WAIT]
a terrible instrument of[LINE]
destruction.[WAIT]
If he awakens, then he[LINE]
will surely destroy[LINE]
everyone and everything.[WAIT]
Not only you humans, but[LINE]
the residents here of[LINE]
the Abyss,[WAIT]
that you call "demons."[LINE]
Everyone and everything[LINE]
on this world will be[WAIT]
wiped out.[WAIT]
[LINE]
I am the Lord of the[LINE]
Abyss.[WAIT]
I cannot just sit idly[LINE]
by and watch my people[LINE]
die.[WAIT]
When Satan appears, I[LINE]
intend to fight him in[LINE]
one final battle.[WAIT]
And no matter what, I[LINE]
must win![WAIT]
No matter what the[LINE]
cost...[WAIT]
Even if it means my own[LINE]
death, I cannot let my[LINE]
subjects be slaughtered[WAIT]
like so many cattle. Let[LINE]
me be frank, though.[WAIT]
The odds are against me.[LINE]
I may need your help.[WAIT]
[LINE]
But while you are[LINE]
powerful,[WAIT]
I still do not know for[LINE]
sure whether or not your[LINE]
power is enough to aid[WAIT]
me, or if you are right[LINE]
for the job.[WAIT]
I must test you to make[LINE]
sure first.[WAIT]
[LINE]
{Aleph}, your arrival[LINE]
here was a bit...forced,[LINE]
so I won't ask you to[WAIT]
make up your mind now.[WAIT]
If you have the power[LINE]
and the strength of will[LINE]
to fight Satan alongside[WAIT]
me, return here to[LINE]
Kether Castle.[WAIT]
That shall be your test.[WAIT]
If you will join me, I[LINE]
want you to do so[LINE]
entirely of your own[WAIT]
volition. I will be[LINE]
waiting....[WAIT]

But remember this![WAIT]
Humans are not strong[LINE]
enough to live on their[LINE]

[LINE]
....There is more you[LINE]

I was using Moloch to[LINE]

and give that energy to[LINE]
the mountains of the[LINE]
Makai...[WAIT]
the body of the great[LINE]
dragon, Kuzuryu.[WAIT]
[LINE]
YHVH...God ordered all[LINE]
of this.[WAIT]
He commanded me to[LINE]
gather the energy,[WAIT]
and then use the Kuzuryu[LINE]
to enact worldwide [LINE]
destruction.[WAIT]
He wants to destroy all[LINE]
of mankind. I pretended[LINE]
to obey....[WAIT]
[LINE]
However, the destruction[LINE]
the Kuzuryu would cause[LINE]
would be disastrous for[WAIT]
the residents of the[WAIT]
Abyss as well--demonkind[LINE]
cannot survive without[LINE]
humanity![WAIT]
Secretly, I planned to[LINE]
use the power of Kuzuryu[LINE]
not to destroy the[WAIT]
world, but to liberate[LINE]
the Abyss...[WAIT]
but God learned of my[LINE]
plan,[WAIT]
and made Gabriel ready a[LINE]
new weapon of global[LINE]
destruction.[WAIT]
[LINE]
The secret to that[LINE]
weapon is in Eden....[WAIT]
....The Kuzuryu will[LINE]
soon begin to destroy[LINE]

Without me to control[LINE]

//{Aleph}-in other[LINE]

the Center to become the[LINE]
Savior.[WAIT]
After the cataclysmic[LINE]
destruction of Tokyo[LINE]
nearly a century ago,[WAIT]
the world was reduced to[LINE]
ashes. From those ashes,[LINE]
the Mesian Church tried[WAIT]
to create the "Thousand[LINE]
Year Kingdom" to save[LINE]
the people.[WAIT]
"Tokyo Millennium" is[LINE]
the result of their[LINE]
efforts.[WAIT]
[LINE]
However, according to[LINE]
the prophecy, the return[LINE]
of the Savior would be[WAIT]
necessary before the[LINE]
Kingdom could actually[LINE]
come into being.[WAIT]
After building the city,[LINE]
they waited and waited[LINE]
for that Savior...[WAIT]
...but in the end, he[LINE]
never came.[WAIT]
[LINE]
Therefore, the Elders at[LINE]
the Center decided to[LINE]
create their own Savior.[WAIT]
They thought if they[LINE]
created his body, God[LINE]
would provide his soul.[WAIT]
And the result of that[LINE]
effort was you,[LINE]
{Aleph}.[WAIT]
[LINE]
In addition, with their[LINE]
advanced bio-technology,[LINE]
they created four others[WAIT]
to help guide you on the[LINE]
path to becoming the[LINE]
Savior.[WAIT]
[LINE]
{Beth} was made to be[LINE]
your partner.[WAIT]
[LINE]
{Gimmel} was made to be[LINE]
the administrator of the[LINE]
virtual world,[WAIT]
to test the technology[LINE]
that would become the[LINE]
Thousand Year Kingdom[WAIT]
that everyone would be[LINE]
eventually hooked up to.[WAIT]
[LINE]
{Daleth} was designed as[LINE]
the Anti-Messiah, to be[LINE]
defeated at your hands,[WAIT]
as an effort to boost[LINE]
your popularity.[WAIT]
[LINE]
Finally, {Zayin} was to[LINE]
be your bodyguard...[WAIT]
[LINE]
You alone differed from[LINE]
the other four in a[LINE]
fundamental way.[WAIT]
Whereas the others were[LINE]
created through advanced[LINE]
cloning techniques,[WAIT]
you alone started as a[LINE]
fertilized human egg.[WAIT]
First, this egg was[LINE]
altered and strengthened[LINE]
in a bio-laboratory.[WAIT]
Then, it was implanted[LINE]
into the uterus of a[LINE]
strong, capable young[WAIT]
woman who brought you to[LINE]
term.[WAIT]
[LINE]
After you were born, you[LINE]
were taken from this[LINE]
woman, put in the same[WAIT]
type of vat as the other[LINE]
four, and then had your[LINE]
growth accelerated so[WAIT]
a day's worth in the vat[LINE]
was like 10 years of[LINE]
aging normally.[WAIT]
We had you raised to[LINE]
full adulthood within no[LINE]
